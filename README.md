# Meets+

Meets+ is an easy-to-use tool that augments the Google Meet platform with 'Picture-in-Picture' and 'full screen' functionalities. 

The Picture-in-Picture feature supports up to three (3) videos at a time, which allows you to keep an eye on what's happening on the call while interacting with other sites and applications.

The full screen feature works slightly different from Google Meet's built-in full screen feature, in that it allows you to select a video that will take up the screen's full width and height, with the option of automatically opening any other videos on the call in a Picture-in-Picture window.
